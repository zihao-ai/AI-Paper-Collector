## <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LightChen233/blog-img/resource.png" width="25" /> Installation

Current installation is to clone this repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MLNLP-World/AI-Paper-Collector.git
cd AI-Paper-Collector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LightChen233/blog-img/catalogue.png" width="27" /> Usage(v0.1.0)

We provide three usage modes, the first is [**interactive**](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/AI-Paper-Collector#-interactive-usage-with-example) (`main.py`), the second is [**command-line**](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/AI-Paper-Collector#-command-line-usage) (`cli_main.py`) and the other is [**web interface**](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/AI-Paper-Collector#-web-interface-usage) (`app.py`).
The interactive mode is recommended for the first time users.

### <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LightChen233/blog-img/notes.png" width="23" /> Interactive Usage with Example

To start the interactive, type:

```shell
python main.py
```

The initialization of indices and posting-list may take several seconds when you first use this script, after that they will be stored in `./output/` and you don't have to initialized them again. When the `./cache/cache.json` is updated, you should manually delete `./output/postings.pkl` and run `main.py` again.

Serveral steps to interactively search paper.

1. the keyword query
2. search mode (exact, fuzzy or boolean)
3. (fuzzy) threshold
4. the limit of results
5. a list of conferences, separated by comma
6. the file path of the output (top-5 for command preview, all results in this file)

E.g.

```
[+] Initializing System...
[+] Loading from cache...
[+] Enter your query: few-shot

[+] Select search mode:
	[1] Exact
	[2] Fuzzy
  [3] Boolean
[+] Enter a number between 1 to 3: 2
[+] Enter threshold between 0 and 100 (default: 50):
[+] Enter limit >= 0 (default: None):
[+] Enter the list of confs separated by comma
	E.g. "ACL,CVPR" or "AAAI" or enter nothing for all confs
[+] Enter your list of conferences (default: All Confs): SIGIR,WSDM,CIKM

[+] Search Results:
[=] Only show Top-5, Please Save results to see all.
[1] [CIKM2021] REFORM: Error-Aware Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion.
[2] [CIKM2021] Boosting Few-shot Abstractive Summarization with Auxiliary Tasks.
[3] [CIKM2021] Multi-objective Few-shot Learning for Fair Classification.
[4] [CIKM2020] Graph Few-shot Learning with Attribute Matching.
[5] [CIKM2020] Few-shot Insider Threat Detection.

[+] Enter Save filename:
[+] Writing results to output/fuzzy_None_SIGIR_WSDM_CIKM_few-shot.txt
[+] Writing results Done!
```

### Boolean Query Rules:
For boolean search, you can use the standard boolean expressions with [AND, OR, NOT] and brackets. For example, you can write your queries like:

1. language AND generation AND (pre-train OR pretrain)
2. (dialogue OR dialog) AND generation AND NOT (response AND selection)
3. toxic AND (dialogue OR conversation OR dialog)

Note that when you want to search for a phrase (e.g. contrastive learning), you should type `contrastive AND learning` instead of leaving blank between the words like `contrastive learning`.

The boolean query allows you to search exactly the key-words that you are interested in. Besides, it also helps to include the near-synonyms (like dialog, dialogue and conversation) and exclude the words that you are not interested in (like the second example).

### <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LightChen233/blog-img/notes.png" width="23" /> Command-line Usage

For command-line usage, you can use the following commands:

```shell
# -q, --query:     the input query, and the content with multiple words should be wrapped in quotation marks
# -m, --mode:      the search mode: fuzzy or exact, default is exact
# -t, --threshold: the threshold for the fuzzy search, default is 50
# -l, --limit:     the limit num of the fuzzy search result, default is None
# -c, --conf:      the list of the conferences needs to search, default is all
# -o, --output:    the output file name, default is [mode]_[threshold]_[confs]_[query].txt
# -f, --force:     force to update the cache file incrementally
python cli_main.py --query QUERY \
    [--mode {fuzzy,exact}] \
    [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--limit LIMIT] [--conf CONF] \
    [--output OUTPUT] [--force]
```

E.g.

```shell
# Note that the input query must be enclosed in `""`, such as "few shot".
python cli_main.py -q "few shot" -m fuzzy -l 10 -t 10 -c AAAI,ACL -o results.txt
```

### <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/LightChen233/blog-img/notes.png" width="23" /> Web interface Usage

For web interface usage, you can use the following commands:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open the following URL: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Automatically Updating via an issue-triggered workflow

If anyone wants to add a new list of conferences. please raise an issue following the format of this one.
We will check and label it, then the workflow will run automatically.
[issue format](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/AI-Paper-Collector/issues/10)

### For users who clone the project to use

- add new conferences by modifying the `conf/dblp_conf.json` file

```python
[
    # add the name and dblp_url of the new conf
    {
        "name": "WWW2021",
        "url": "https://dblp.org/db/conf/www/www2021.html"
    },
    ...
]
```

- run the script

```shell
# force to update the cache file incrementally
python cli_main.py --query '' --force
```
